Project Milestone:
    Currently we have all the basic structure of our project completed. There are a couple places where the layout may need to be slightly touched up, for 
    example in the spot where the bracket and table are currently overlapping. The table entries also need to be center aligned and we need to look into 
    how to get this to work because simply setting the style to be align: center is not working. Then, the basic infobox and line chart structure is set up 
    at the bottom of the table. Then, the structure of the line chart is also set up but actually getting the line 
    to show up properly is proving to be difficult so for right now just the line chart structure has been completed. Currently the general structure of our
    visualization has been completed but the interactive features are not yet functional.
    
Moving Forward:
    Next we are going to get the line in the line chart for a selected country working. Then, we will start implementing the interactive features of getting the 
    bracket to change as the selected world cup year is changed and getting the infobox and line start to change as different countries are selected in the map.
    After this has been completed we will add in the linked view feature of once a world cup year is selected the winner, runners-up, and third place will be 
    shaded in the map for that world cup and we will also implement a way to encoding the host country into the map as well. Once this has been completed we will 
    get our web server working which will run our visualization. After all of these required things have been completed if time permits we may add in two storytelling
    buttons which are show hosts and show winners they will each shade all countries that have previously hosted/won the world cup respectively on the map and they 
    will also bring up an infobox saying a little bit about the important facts of the hosts and winners like that Brazil has won the most world cup and in 2010 that
    South Africa became the first country in Africa to host the world cup.
